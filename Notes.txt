Calling findViewById() for every view that we want to connect with is inefficient. We will access the app data directly from XML. 

Data Binding :
An Object that contains the references to each view is called binding object. This process is called data binding.

Benefits:
-  Code becomes shorter. 
- Code becomes easier to read, easier to understand and maintain.
- Data & Views are seperated clearly.
- the android system only traverses the view hierarcy only once to get each view, and it happens during the app start up not at run time.
- You get type safety (Means that the compiler validates types when compiling)

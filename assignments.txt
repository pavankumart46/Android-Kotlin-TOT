Please do the following assignments

For Dice Roller, Create two dices with the feature to roll them at once. Both the dices should show a value of their own. 
Also, Create an upcount button, which when clicked updates both the dices by value 1. 
If any dice has value 6, Nothing should happen. 
If upcount button is clicked without rolling the dice, it should display 1.
